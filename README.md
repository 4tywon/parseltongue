## Introduction
*parseltongue* is a Google Chrome extension that enables users to learn the language of their choice with minimal effort, while interacting with the Internet as they normally would. 

## Inspiration
While our daily lives revolve around the use of the Internet, we felt that there wasn't a great way to learn a language with minimal effort. We wanted to change this, so we aimed to develop a Chrome extension that teaches the user a new language without adding another task to their to-do list. With that in mind, our extension integrates with the web surfing and research that a user already does. 

With *parseltongue*, a user no longer needs to devote time to learning a new language. The time already spent on the Internet can be leveraged to learn a new language. As a user develops a more developed vocabulary, *parseltongue* translates more of the web page's words into the language being learned. A user can then view their progress over time and see how much they've improved. 

## What It Does
*parseltongue* is a Google Chrome extension that translates a percentage of a web page's words into the language that a user is trying to learn. As a user begins to learn and develop their vocabulary, a greater number of the words on a web page are translated. A user can then click on the words that are translated and check that they've either learned the word in the context or they still don't know what the word means. Through the dashboard, a user can see their progress over time and see how their comprehension percentage has increased. 

## How We Built It


## Challenges


## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
We're proud of developing a Chrome extension that enables a user to intuitively learn a language. Our extension seamlessly integrates with Google Chrome and teaches the user the language of their choice. Ideally, we hope that this tool will enable people to communicate with others of different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. We envision a future where people don't view learning a new language and traveling as such a significant barrier. We hope that through using our extension, people can travel the world and experience it from a new perspective.  

## What We Learned
We learned that it's possible to develop an impactful piece of software in a short period of time. We also learned how to utilize  [stdlib](https://stdlib.com/) to simplify our development process.
